- # 🎨 Hako — Personal Website Concept

**Hako** is a design-driven concept originally intended to become a personal website. Although the project was paused in its early development stage, it remains an interesting visual experiment worth preserving. It reflects a minimalist and expressive approach to digital self-presentation.

## 🧠 Project Idea

The project was envisioned as a clean, elegant personal site combining:

- Minimalist visual composition  
- Smooth animations and transitions  
- Simple, intuitive navigation  
- Aesthetic of a digital business card

The goal was to create a space that reflects the author's personality through design rather than complex functionality.
